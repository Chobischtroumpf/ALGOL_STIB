# Configuration for BETransitPathfinder

# --- Pathfinder Pruning Settings ---
# Determines how much a path can deviate from the straight-line direction to the target.
# A value of 1.25 means the next stop can't be more than 25% further away from the target
# than the current stop is.
pathfinder.pruning.deviation_tolerance=1.25

# When exploring connections from a stop within a single trip, this limits how many
# subsequent stops are considered. Helps prune the search space.
pathfinder.pruning.max_stops_to_consider=5

# --- Pathfinder Cost Settings ---
# The baseline penalty added for switching between different modes of transport.
# This value is modified by the chosen optimization strategy.
pathfinder.cost.mode_switch_penalty=5.0
